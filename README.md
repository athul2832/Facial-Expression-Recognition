# Facial-Expression-Recognition

Simple Face Recognition — a collection of Jupyter notebooks and supporting code demonstrating a simple facial expression recognition pipeline (data preparation, model training, evaluation and a lightweight demo). The primary work is in notebooks so you can read, reproduce and iterate quickly.

## About
This project demonstrates a minimal pipeline for recognizing facial expressions from images (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised). It was developed for learning and experimentation and is intentionally simple so you can extend it with larger datasets, different model architectures, or deployment targets.

## Features
- End-to-end notebooks covering:
  - data loading & preprocessing
  - model architecture (simple CNN example)
  - training loop, metrics and plots
  - evaluation and confusion matrix
  - lightweight webcam/demo (if included)
- Reproducible, notebook-based workflow for experimentation
- Notes and suggestions for improving performance

## Repository structure
(Adjust to match the actual files in this repo)
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks (primary content)
  - 01-data-prep.ipynb
  - 02-training.ipynb
  - 03-evaluation.ipynb
  - 04-demo-webcam.ipynb
- data/ — (not committed) instructions and small sample data
- models/ — saved model checkpoints (not committed)
- requirements.txt — Python packages (optional)
- README.md — this file

## Requirements
Recommended:
- Python 3.8+
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
- Common libraries:
  - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
  - opencv-python
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow and keras (or pytorch if you've adapted notebooks)
  - tqdm

If a requirements.txt exists, install with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or create a conda environment:
```
conda create -n fer python=3.9
conda activate fer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/athul2832/Facial-Expression-Recognition.git
cd Facial-Expression-Recognition
```
2. Install dependencies (see Requirements).
3. Launch Jupyter:
```
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder and run cells in order.

## How to run the notebooks
- Start with the data preparation notebook to load and preprocess images.
- Move to the training notebook to define and train the model. Adjust hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, learning rate) as needed.
- Use the evaluation notebook to inspect metrics, generate confusion matrices and visualise mistakes.
- If available, run the demo notebook for a webcam-based prediction demo.

Each notebook contains explanatory text and example hyperparameters so you can reproduce the results step-by-step.

## Typical workflow
1. Acquire / prepare dataset (see Dataset below).
2. Preprocess: face detection, crop, resize, normalization, label encoding.
3. Train: start with a small CNN, try transfer learning (MobileNet, EfficientNet) for better results.
4. Evaluate: accuracy, precision/recall per class, confusion matrix.
5. Iterate: augment data, tune architecture and hyperparameters.

## Dataset
This repo is dataset-agnostic. Common datasets for facial expression recognition:
- FER2013 (Kaggle)
- CK+ (extended Cohn-Kanade)
- RAF-DB

Do NOT commit large datasets to the repo. Place datasets in `data/` (or a path of your choice) and point the notebooks to that location. Example file structure inside `data/`:
```
data/
  train/
    happy/
    sad/
    angry/
    ...
  val/
  test/
```

## Model & training notes
- The notebooks use a small convolutional neural network as an example; switching to a pretrained backbone (transfer learning) will usually improve accuracy.
- Use image augmentation (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, brightness jitter) to make models more robust.
- Monitor for overfitting: compare train and validation loss/accuracy.
- Save the best checkpoint and export a small inference model for demos.

## Troubleshooting & tips
- If Jupyter kernels die: check memory & GPU drivers.
- If training is slow: use a smaller batch or enable GPU (CUDA) and ensure TensorFlow/PyTorch GPU builds are installed.
- Webcam demo not working: ensure OpenCV is installed, camera permissions are allowed, and the notebook is run on a machine with a camera.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested ways to help:
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests
- Submit PRs to add support for more datasets or model architectures
- Share trained model weights (host externally) and update the demo to load them

If you open an issue or PR, please include:
- clear description of the change
- steps to reproduce (if bug)
- small code snippet or notebook cell demonstrating the problem/fix
